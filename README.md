# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters. Poster images load asynchronously.
- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.
- [x] User sees an error message when there is a network error.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add a tab bar for **Now Playing** and **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Implement segmented control to switch between list view and grid view.
- [x] Add a search bar.
- [x] All images fade in.
- [x] For the large poster, load the low-res image first, switch to high-res when complete.
- [ ] Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Enabled search for the grid view. This is still a bit buggy but I can't seem to figure it out. Sorry!!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The search function for a collection view was pretty challenging for me. I spent a good amount of time debugging the issues but still could not figure out how to implement it the way I wanted. I'm sure there is the "right" way to do it but I guess I didn't know how for now. Also towards the end, I felt like I was kind of hacking my way through some of the features. Hopefully we will get to learn how to do it in a cleaner way.
